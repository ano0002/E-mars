# E-mars

Messrs HORMONE, PREVOTAT, SIMON, SOT and Ms CORDIER offer you a mission: E-MARS.
    
    Through this game you will not be confronted with aliens, but with yourself. Indeed, E-MARS has a simple goal: you must succeed in taking off from Mars as quickly as possible. But time will be your enemy. Throughout the game you will be guided by the instructions at the bottom of the screen to complete your mission.



/!\ To start the game, make sure you have downloaded the entire "E-MARS" file, and that you have a recent and up-to-date Python program. You also need pygame and opencv-python to run the game. /!\

    pip install pygame
    pip install opencv-python
